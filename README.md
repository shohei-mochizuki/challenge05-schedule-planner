# Challenge 05 Third-Party API: Schedule Planner

## Description

This is a webpage where you can save your work schedule for a day.
It also tells you what day it is and if the plans/events are past/present/future ones with a color code scheme.
Originally created for Module 5 challenge of UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp - Third-Party API.


## Usage

Type your schedule/plan/event in the desired timeslot box (9AM to 5PM).
Save it by clicking the disk icon next to the input box.
This data is saved in your local storage. Hence it remains there even if you refresh the page. 

The color code scheme is as follow:
* Grey: Past plan/event
* Red: Current plan/event
* Green: Future plan/event
