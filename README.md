When your answer is wrong, some seconds are subtracted from your remaining time.
When you answer all your questions or the time is over, the quiz ends.
You can see your score and save it with your initials after clicking "Submit" button.
When you click "View Highscores" button, you can see all the past high scores.
You can delete these information by clicking "Clear Highscores" button.

In the JavaScript file (script.js), you can easily change the following items:
* Questions and answers
* How long (how many seconds) will the user be given
* How long (how many seconds) will be subtracted when the answer is wrong
* How many top scorers will be shown
