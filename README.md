## Description

This is a webpage where you can save your work schedule for a day.
It also tells you what day it is and if the plans/events are past/present/future ones with a color code scheme.
Originally created for Module 5 challenge of UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp - Third-Party API.


## Usage

Type your schedule/plan/event in the desired timeslot box (9AM to 5PM).
